Controller Area Network (CAN)
Introduction: Controller Area Network (CAN) is a robust vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other without a host computer. It was originally developed by Bosch in the 1980s for in-vehicle networking but has since found applications in various industries due to its reliability and efficiency.

Key Features:
    •	Message-Based Protocol: CAN is a message-based protocol, meaning that data is transmitted in frames, each identified by a unique identifier.
    •	Multi-Master Capability: Any node can initiate communication, making the network highly flexible.
    •	Error Detection and Handling: CAN includes multiple error detection mechanisms and automatic retransmission of corrupted messages.
    •	Real-Time Communication: CAN supports real-time communication with a high level of determinism.

CAN Arbitration
Overview: CAN arbitration is the process by which nodes on a CAN bus determine which node has the right to transmit data when multiple nodes attempt to send messages simultaneously. This is crucial for avoiding data collisions and ensuring efficient communication.

Arbitration Process:
    1.	Message Priority: Each CAN message has a unique identifier, which also determines its priority. Lower numerical values indicate higher priority.
    2.	Bit-by-Bit Arbitration: During arbitration, nodes transmit their message identifiers bit by bit. The CAN bus uses a dominant (logical 0) and recessive (logical 1) bit level system.
    3.	Dominant vs. Recessive: If a node transmits a recessive bit but detects a dominant bit on the bus, it stops transmitting and waits for the next arbitration round.
    4.	Winning Node: The node with the highest priority (lowest identifier) continues to transmit, while others switch to listening mode.
